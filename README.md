The honeypot server successfully attracted and recorded multiple brute-force login attempts and suspicious commands. Cowrie provided detailed logs of attacker interactions, while custom Python scripts automated the extraction and analysis of key information. The SSH/FTP emulation effectively deceived attackers into revealing their methods. This project demonstrates that honeypots are a powerful tool for studying attacker behavior and strengthening overall cybersecurity defenses
